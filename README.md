# Talking-bots-genai

Two audio bots will have a conversation on a topic given by a user.

This repository contains a **Node.js backend** and a **React frontend** designed to work together seamlessly. The structure ensures clear separation of concerns while providing an easy way to manage dependencies and run both projects simultaneously.

Currently it only runs on Chrome browser.
